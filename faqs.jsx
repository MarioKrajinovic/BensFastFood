        question: "DO YOU ACCOMMODATE GLUTEN, DAIRY, AND SOY ALLERGIES?",
        answer: "Yes! None of our food contains gluten, dairy, or soy. Our entire menu is crafted to be free of these ingredients. Please note if you have a severe allergy that we purchase some ingredients from manufacturers and distributors that may process these ingredients in the same facility, so we cannot guarantee that trace amounts of these ingredients are not present in our kitchen. In the future, we'd *love* (and trust us, we're dreaming of the day!) to be able to certify that our food is completely free of these ingredients at all of our suppliers."

Our goal is to share food that is as plant-centric as possible, while still providing options for folks who eat meat."

        answer: "Because of COVID-19, we're taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of our food, customers, staff, and delivery drivers. We've increased hand washing and sanitation frequency in our restaurant above and beyond health code recommendations, all staff is required to wear masks and gloves, social distancing is enforced, we're accepting online orders only with contactless pickup, and we've added tamper-free packaging as an additional precaution. Delivery drivers are also encouraged to provide contactless deliveries wherever possible."
